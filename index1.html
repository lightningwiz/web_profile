<!--OBJECTIVE--><BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>Welcome to my profile web page.</H1>
Here you will find relevant information of work history, experience, special skills, and education.<!--The ongoing goal is to secure a position in the area of IT Project/Process/Data Management that is commensurable with skills, experience, and training since obtained. To be a part of an organization that is innovative and continuously strives for improvement in products, projects, and processes. One in which I could use my current skills and experience, as well as expand them to assist the organization in being successful.<br><br>-->
As the son of a welder/pipefitter and seamstress/homemaker, early life experiences lends itself to familiarity with many types of materials and various fabrication processes. Learned to operate sewing machines by 12 years old and could stick weld by 15. Rolling up welding leads and torch hoses is part of early memories helping dad on local jobs for friends and family.<br><br>
Aside from bagging groceries, stocking shelves, busing tables, and scrubbing cookware, some early jobs not formally listed as experience include laying sod, concrete flat-work and formed walls, insulating pipe and ductwork, welding, and magazine publisher's mailroom dispatcher. Just out of high school, worked for a year as a third class welder at Jeff Boat Inc. until 1981 when production and subsequently the workforce was cut back.
