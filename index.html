<!--OBJECTIVE--><BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>Welcome</H1>
<H3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Strengths include a vast experience in computers, computer applications, operating systems, networks, networking, and communications. Particularly in the areas of Enterprise Resource Planning and Manufacturing Requirements Planning applications on company business computer systems. Mechanically incline to aid in accurate bill of material and production route creation in any ERP/MRP system. Utilizing twenty plus years implementing ERP/MRP systems in the wood and steel office furniture industries. Check my skills <a href="MLH_Skills.html">page</a> for strengths and talents.

Here can be found relevant information of education, special skills, experience, and work history. As the son of a welder/pipefitter and seamstress/homemaker, early life experiences lends itself to familiarity with many types of materials and various fabrication processes. Operated sewing machines and could stick weld at an early age. Rolling up welding leads and torch hoses is part of early memories helping dad on local jobs for friends and family.

<!--OBJECTIVE-->
<H3><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp While in high school performed odd jobs like mowing grass, raking leaves, bagging groceries, stocking shelves, busing tables, and scrubbing cookware. Some early jobs not formally listed as experience include laying sod, concrete flat-work and formed walls, insulating pipe and ductwork, welding, and magazine publisher's mailroom dispatcher. Just out of high school, worked for a year as a third class welder at Jeff Boat Inc. until 1981 when production and subsequently the workforce was cut back. Check my experience <a href="MLH_Work.html">page</a> for current and recent experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Although not indicated as a position held, production-scheduling support is a primary responsibility. In fact, working closely with Sentry Safe Cannelton’s production scheduler is critical to accurate order fulfillment and meeting on time delivery. Custom ordered finished goods are setup daily for the production scheduler to send on to production. Working with customer service, production planning and purchasing to ensure the appropriate amounts of the right parts or materials arrive to assure timely completion of these custom finished goods and as well as all other standard products.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Regarding the job FireKing title, Design Engineering is the title given at the time for the role performed. The title is misleading although drafting and CAD training is a large part of my background, the accurate reading of design drawings is critical to the roles performed at both FireKing and Sentry Safe Cannelton. At FireKing reporting to the Engineering Department manager and acting as the intermediate for product design and the MRP/ERP system utilized by all departments is the primary reason for the Design Engineering title although the more aptly named title should be Data Systems Analyst. Working cross functionally with production systems, purchasing and sales processes, and translating engineering designs into MRP quantifiable data gains me the currently held position title of SAP Master Data Analyst. Either title sounds impressive but does not really describe what the job responsibilities are, when asked I usually tell people that I put the part numbers, bill of materials, and routings into the company’s business computer so that all departments get the information they need to make their daily job decisions.</p></H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
